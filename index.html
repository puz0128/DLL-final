          <h1>My experience in programming</h1>
          <br>
          <p>
            Since I was in seventh grade, ICT teachers use to work html with us. <br>
            At the beginning it was boring for me because it was to learn many
            tags and more, but I took a programming class in platzi and I develop
            programming logic which allow me to create a webpage in html and css
            in a correct way. I continued studying and practicing with html and
            css when I knew there was another programming language which completes
            or complements the html and css, we are talking about JavaScript. I'm
            still learning that programming language and then start using python.
          </p>
            <p>
              During any programming process, is common to make mistakes. If you
              have a letter incorrect, quotation marks are open but you forget to
              close, etc. probably the code isn't going to work.
